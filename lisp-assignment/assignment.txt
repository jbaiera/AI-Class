Do one from group I, two from group II, and two from group III. All programs are to be written in lisp.

Group I.
    1. Write a recursive program to compute the Fibonacci sequence.
    2. Write a recursive program to compute the average of a sequence of numbers in a list.

Group II.
    3. Write an iterative program which reads in integers from the terminal and outputs the type of the number.
    4. Write an iterative program which reads a file containing the midterm grades of the ten students in class and computes the average, median, and range of scores.
    5. Write an iterative program which sorts the elements of a list using quicksort.

Group III.
    6. Write an iterative program which averages a 16x16 matrix into a 4x4 matrix such that every 4x4 matrix of the original matrix is averaged to generate one element in the output matrix.
    7. Write an iterative program that performs pyramid averaging. In pyramid averaging, the initial nxn matrix is summarized by taking the average of the 4x4 cells each time. (Example: 64x64 -> 16x16 -> 4x4 -> 1x1)
    8. Write a recursive program which adds two polynomials.
