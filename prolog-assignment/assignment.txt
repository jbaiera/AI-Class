Basic set (pick two):
    1. Write a simple program to define the relation uncle/2.
    2. Write a simple program to compute a Fibonacci number using a blackboard to store the 
       Fibonacci numbers computed earlier so they can be looked up instead of recomputed.
    3. Write a program to simulate the struct in class and read the data from an input file
       containing the class assignment and test scores and computes and prints out the
       final grade.

Data structure programming (pick two):
    4. Write a program that substitutes all occurrences of an element in a given list by
       another given element. Ex: subs(1, a, [1,3,2,1,4]) gives [a,3,2,a,4].
    5. Write a program to find the median of a list of numbers.
    6. Write a program to make a frequency table for a given data set. The frequency
       table is a list of pairs. The first of each pair is the value and the second is its
       frequency.

Searching and sorting (pick two):
    7. Write a program to perform quicksort.
    8. Write a program to perform heapsort.
    9. Write a program to search a given string in a file and give all its locations as a
       list of pairs of line number and starting column number.
